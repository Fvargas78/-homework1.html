       <p><strong>Hello and welcome to my website!!</strong><br>As an immigrannt, moving from one place to another,the language barrier was my first obstacle to access to a higher education  in United States. Unfortunately, there's few Latinos and minorities in tech, and only 3 percent of tech execs are Hispanic. This is one of the reasons i would like to become a web developer, because in a country with a population growing more diverse each day, the U.S. tech community is monochromatic, a bastion of white, male privilege. People of color largely remain shut out of the tech industry. As a gay latino i would like to be an examples of what is possible when you wholeheartedly pursue your dreams. the other main reason i am interested in becoming a web developer is because it is a creative job. And lastly, this is a high demand job, with web technology in constant growth, it’s a pretty exciting place to be. And with countless companies on the lookout for new talent, it’s a perfect chance for aspiring developers to find their perfect role.<br> One person who inspire me to pursue my dreams in coding is my friend Arlen McCluskey, his website reflects all his hard world through the years. Take a look at his website:
